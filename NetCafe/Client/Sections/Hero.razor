            Hello, I'm Rasheed 👋🏻</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm font-light dark:text-gray-200 mt-3">
            Hi! My name is <span class="text-blue-500 font-bold">Rasheed Mozaffar</span> and this is my personal blog.
            I've been coding for more than a
            year now
            and along side coding, I found my passion in writing and sharing the knowledge I have with others, be it
            <b>C#
                (My favorite), HTML & CSS, Web development technologies OR any general programming concepts</b>.
            This blog isn't only about coding. It's also about my journey and discoveries, the challenges I face, the
            projects I make, and any thoughts that come to my mind, so I'm sure you'll find something that piques your
            interest here!
